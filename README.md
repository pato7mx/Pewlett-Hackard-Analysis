# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

We wanted to analyze the number of uipcoming retirees by title and department. This information will help the company prepare for the "silver tsunami." We also looked into which employees are eligible to the mentorship program to help replace the talent that is leaving the Pewlett Hackard. 
## RESULTS

Total employees retiring from the company in the next five years: 90,398

From this image, we can see that there will be several "Senior" personnel leaving the company. This means that many positions will free up in a position that requieres a lot of expierence, thus the mentorship program will be key. 

## Mentorship program

From our analysis we know that there are 1549 possible candidates for the program. This may seem like a lot but when you consider the amount of senior talent retiring soon (57,668 senior employees) then we can conclude that the company will have some rough years if they don't bring in talent fast.
